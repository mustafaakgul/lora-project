### Embedded LoRaWAN Library for RN2483A - Guide

A step by step guide how to empower the Embedded LoRaWAN Library Plug-In for MPLAB Code Configurator and RN2483A. 

This entry level guide would be useful for everybody who are making their first steps with MPLAB X, MPLAB Code Configurator and LoRAWAN. The guide is intended to get you up to speed and finish your project easier and faster.

#### About LoRaWAN:

The [LoRaWAN®](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) specification is a Low Power, Wide Area (LPWA) networking protocol designed to wirelessly connect battery operated ‘things’ to the internet in regional, national or global networks, and targets key Internet of Things (IoT) requirements such as bi-directional communication, end-to-end security, mobility and localization services.

#### About RN2483A:

The [RN2483A](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/RN2483) is a fully-certified 433/868 MHz module based on wireless LoRa® technology. The RN2483 utilizes a unique spread spectrum modulation within the Sub-GHz band to enable long range, low power, and high network capacity. 

The module's embedded LoRaWAN™ Class A protocol enables seamless connectivity to any LoRaWAN compliant network infrastructure, whether public or privately deployed. The module is specifically designed for ease of use, which shortens development time and speeds time to market. LoRa technology is ideal for battery-operated sensors and low power applications such as IoT, M2M, Smart City, Sensor networks, Industrial automation, and more.
